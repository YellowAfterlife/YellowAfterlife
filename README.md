Hello! I'm Vadym. I wrote code for [some videogames](https://yal.cc/works) that you might have heard of!

I do netcode and systems programming for games (in Haxe, GameMaker, C++, and C#), web applications (in Haxe and JS), and tool programming (usually in Haxe).

My repositories are split up into ~~categories~~ organizations:

- [Haxe things](https://github.com/YAL-Haxe)  
  Haxe-specific libraries and tools.
- [GameMaker Things](https://github.com/YAL-GameMaker)  
  Various GameMaker projects and extensions.
- [GameMaker Tools](https://github.com/YAL-GameMaker-Tools)  
  GameMaker-specific tools - automation, format converters, etc.
- [Godot Things](https://github.com/YAL-Godot)
  A few example projects and tests for Godot.
- [Game Tools](https://github.com/YAL-Game-Tools)  
  Game-specific tools (patchers, editors, etc.).
- [Game Things](https://github.com/YAL-Game-Things)
