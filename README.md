Hello! I'm Vadim. I wrote code for [some videogames](https://yal.cc/works) that you might have heard of!

I do netcode and systems programming for games (in Haxe, GameMaker, C++, and C#), web applications (in Haxe and JS), and tool programming (usually in Haxe).

For purposes of organization, my repositories are split up into ~~categories~~ organizations:

- [Haxe things](https://github.com/YAL-Haxe)  
  Haxe-specific libraries and tools.
- [GameMaker Things](https://github.com/YAL-GameMaker)  
  Various GameMaker projects and extensions.
- [GameMaker Tools](https://github.com/YAL-GameMaker-Tools)  
  GameMaker-specific tools - automation, format converters, etc.
- [Game Tools](https://github.com/YAL-Game-Tools)  
  Mods and game-specific tools.
- [GMEdit Things](https://github.com/YAL-GMEdit)  
  Various themes and plugins for [GMEdit](https://github.com/YellowAfterlife/GMEdit/).
- [Forks](https://github.com/YAL-Forks)  
  Various small contributions to other people's code.

Also see:

- [My profile](https://github.com/YellowAfterlife?tab=repositories)  
  Repositories that do not fit any of above categories or have not been organized yet.
- [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/yal_cc/)  
  Older public repositories. I'm gradually migrating these over to GitHub.
- [itch.io page](https://yellowafterlife.itch.io/)  
  A slightly more organized look over my work, open-source or not.
- [My blog](https://yal.cc)  
  Countless posts and tutorials. Code looks cleaner when it's written for reading.
